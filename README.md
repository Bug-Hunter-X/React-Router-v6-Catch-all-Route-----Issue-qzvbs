# React Router v6 Catch-all Route '*' Issue

This repository demonstrates a problem with the catch-all route ('*') in React Router v6.  The issue is that the catch-all route is not rendering when navigating to a non-existent path.  This is unexpected behavior.  The solution involves careful consideration of route order and potential conflicts with other routes.
